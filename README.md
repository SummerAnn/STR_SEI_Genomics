## Introduction

Genomics is at the forefront of modern medicine, and leveraging machine learning techniques can significantly enhance our ability to understand and classify diseases based on genetic data. In this project, we employ the SEI framework to process genetic sequence information and short tandem repeats, ultimately building a robust disease classification model.

## Features

- Utilizes genetic sequence data
- Implements Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis
- Applies machine learning algorithms for disease classification
- SEI framework for efficient data processing
